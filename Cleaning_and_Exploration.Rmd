  Tables 1, 2 and 3 report the estimated yearly insured rates of adults for the nation as a whole, states that adopted medicaid expansion on January 1st 2014, and those states that had not adopted the expansion as of the end of 2015. These insured rates were estimated from the 2011 to 2015 BRFSS which is restricted to adults. This restriction may account for the estimated insured rates reported here being slightly less than those reported by the US Census Bureau. The percentage of insured adults does indeed rise from 2011 to 2015, even in states that did not adopt the Medicaid expansion. Moreover, there appears to be a particularly sharp increase from 2013 to 2015, which corresponds temporally with the initiation of most of the ACA reforms. However, states that did not adopt the Medicaid expansion had lower insured rates than those that did. Figures 1 and 2 show this graphically.

The line segments at the top of each bar indicate the 95% confidence for the percentage of insured adults for that year. It is clear that in both states with and without the Medicaid expansion, insured rates have increased from 2011 to 2015 and there was a sharp boost in insured rates from 2013 to 2014 that corresponds with the initiation of most of the ACA reforms. Also, it is clear that while insured rates increaed for both Medicaid expansion states and non-Medicaid expansion states, overall the percentage of insured adults in states without the expansion is much lower..](plots/Medicaid_IR.png)

Less than .8% of observations had to be removed for any given year. This should not impact our data significantly.
